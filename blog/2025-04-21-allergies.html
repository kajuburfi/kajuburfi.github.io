      I recently learned about my allergies…

  <h1 id="allergies-what-are-they">Allergies, what are they?</h1>
  <p>When your body detects a foriegn item entering, it might mistake it to be harmful, called an <em>allergen</em>. This causes your body to have an <em>allergic reaction</em> to it, which might be just irritable(like itching/rashes), or something more severe(like <em>anaphylaxis</em>). There are a variety of things that may cause an allergy.</p>
  <p>Most allergies(like milk, nuts, etc) develop within 6-8 months after being born. Some others, your body may become allergic after a while. Some of the reactions may occur only when something else is also happening at the same time (such other things are called <em>co-factors</em>).</p>
  <h1 id="what-have-i-got">What have I got?</h1>
  <p>I mainly have an allergy to a specific protein called <em>profilin</em>. It is mainly present in some seafoods(like oyster), and also in melons. But I have eaten melons before, so the doctor said it might have been a cross-contamination. I am also allergic to certain types of pollen, mainly found in the West, which also majorly contain <em>profilin</em>. Another item that contains <em>profilin</em> is latex. So I must avoid latex gloves, and request any doctor (during checkups) to avoid the same. Alternatives are nitrile or vinyl gloves.</p>
  <p>Previously I had known that I had an allergy to <em>Amoxicillin</em>, which belongs to the Penicillin class. I had gotten rashes for a month the last(and only) time I had taken <em>Amoxicillin</em>.</p>
  <p>The reaction that occurs is called <em>anaphyalxis</em>. According to my doctor, what I have is not very severe, since only one “system” is reacting - I feel drowsy and feverish for about 5 min, and then I’m back to normal. I don’t have any rashes nor foaming near the mouth nor becoming unconscious.</p>
  <p>The doctor has advised me to avoid seafood. Melons are okay, since I have eaten them before, and there is no reaction to it. She has given an emergency Epinephrine/Adrenaline injection, which is to injected in a severe case. The injection has to stored in the fridge(not freezer), and has a shelf life of 6 months. We can also use an Epi-pen, but those are unnecessarily expensive(over Rs 10,000 compared to Rs.250). In slightly less intense reactions, I have to take a pill(<em>levocet</em> and <em>ivepred</em>), which are anti-histamines. They have a shelf life of around 3 years.</p>
  <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
  <p>Everyone has allergies. It’s better to know them, and avoid them, rather than to experience it.</p>
