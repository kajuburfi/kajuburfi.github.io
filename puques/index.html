    <li>
      The ideal number of questions to attempt randomly for maximum positive marks in a competetive exam setup. <br>
      Competetive exams generally are Multiple Choice Questions(MCQs), so there is basically a one in four chance of getting a single question right by guessing. But does it scale as such? Most people would hesitate to guess when there is negative marking. This is the maths behind it. <a class="rightLink" href="jee_random.pdf">File</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      The self inductance of a finite straight conductor. <br>
      There are not many resources available online for this question. Even in the <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com">Physics Stack Exchange</a>, there are not many questions or answers related to this. This is my answer. <a class="rightLink" href="L_wire.pdf">File</a>

    <li>
      Effects of Induced Magnetic Fields in a Typical Railgun Problem. <br>
      In the railgun problems considered above(<a href="24.html">Q 24</a> and <a href="25.html">Q 25</a>), we neglect the magnetic fields produced by the current in the wires. But are they truly negligible? Here, we attempt to answer this question by considering the magnetic fields produced by those wires and calculating the effective current induced in the loop. <a class="rightLink" href="railgun_extra.pdf">File</a>
